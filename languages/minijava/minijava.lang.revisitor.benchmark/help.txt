Usage: java -jar ... [regexp*] [options]
 [opt] means optional argument.
 <opt> means required argument.
 "+" means comma-separated list of values.
 "time" arguments accept time suffixes, like "100ms".

                              All/all] 
  -bs <int>                   Batch size: number of benchmark method calls per 
                              operation. (some benchmark modes can ignore this 
                              setting) 
  -e <regexp+>                Benchmarks to exclude from the run. 
  -f [int]                    How many times to forks a single benchmark. Use 0 to 
                              disable forking altogether (WARNING: disabling 
                              forking may have detrimental impact on benchmark 
                              and infrastructure reliability, you might want 
                              to use different warmup mode instead). 
  -foe [bool]                 Should JMH fail immediately if any benchmark had 
                              experienced the unrecoverable error?

  -l                          List matching benchmarks and exit. 
  -lprof                      List profilers.

  -o <filename>               Redirect human-readable output to file. 
  -opi <int>                  Operations per invocation. 
  -p <param={v,}*>            Benchmark parameters. This option is expected to 
                              be used once per parameter. Parameter name and parameter 
                              values should be separated with equals sign. Parameter 
                              values should be separated with commas. 
  -prof <profiler+>           Use profilers to collect additional data. See the 
                              list of available profilers first. 
  -r <time>                   Time to spend at each measurement iteration. 
  -rf <type>                  Result format type. See the list of available result 
                              formats first. 
  -rff <filename>             Write results to given file. 
  -si [bool]                  Synchronize iterations? 
  -t <int>                    Number of worker threads to run with. 
  -tg <int+>                  Override thread group distribution for asymmetric 
                              benchmarks. 
  -tu <TU>                    Output time unit. Available time units are: [m, s, 
                              ms, us, ns]. 
  -v <mode>                   Verbosity mode. Available modes are: [SILENT, NORMAL, 
                              EXTRA] 
  -w <time>                   Time to spend at each warmup iteration. 
  -wbs <int>                  Warmup batch size: number of benchmark method calls 
                              per operation. (some benchmark modes can ignore 
                              this setting) 
  -wf <int>                   How many warmup forks to make for a single benchmark. 
                              0 to disable warmup forks. 
  -wi <int>                   Number of warmup iterations to do.

  -wmb <regexp+>              Warmup benchmarks to include in the run in addition 
                              to already selected. JMH will not measure these benchmarks, 
                              but only use them for the warmup.
